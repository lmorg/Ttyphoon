	Final character C for designating 94-character sets.
	In this list,
	o   0 , A  and B  were introduced in the VT100,
	o   most were introduced in the VT200 series,
	o   a few were introduced in the VT300 series, and
	o   a few more were introduced in the VT500 series.
	The VT220 character sets, together with a few others (such as
	Portuguese) are activated by the National Replacement
	Character Set (NRCS) controls.  The term "replacement" says
	that the character set is formed by replacing some of the
	characters in a set (termed the Multinational Character Set)
	with more useful ones for a given language.  The ASCII and DEC
	Supplemental character sets make up the two halves of the
	Multinational Character set, initially mapped to GL and GR.
	The valid final characters C for this control are:
